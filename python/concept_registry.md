| https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# | DailyRecurringEvent | class | A DailyRecurringEvent may occur at the same time, or different times every day. Therefore, it has at most one associated time – the start time. No associated time indicates that there is no commitment to a recurring start time for the event. A DailyEvent does not necessarily have the same endtime or duration, therefore these are not specified. |
| https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# | ExceptionDay | class |  |
| https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# | MonthlyRecurringEvent | class | A MonthlyRecurringEvent recurs regularly on the same day of each month, as specified by the dayOfMonth data property. Note that there is often ambiguity regarding the semantics of a monthly recurring event: in this formalization, a MonthlyRecurringEvent is any event that recurs regularly on the same day of each month; other interpretations sometimes consider events that recur on the same day of week, or first or last day, in which case the day of month will vary. |
| https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# | RecurringEvent | class | Based on the data model defined in: http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/technical-articles/again-and-again-managing-recurring-events-in-a-data-model but is integrated into the general city ontology. |
| https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# | RecurringEventThing | class | Class added for organizational purposes only; to group all classes defined in the recurring-event ontology. |
| https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# | WeeklyRecurringEvent | class | A WeeklyRecurringEvent recurs on the regularly on the same day of the week, as specified by the schema:dayOfWeek property. |
| https://standards.iso.org/iso-iec/5087/-1/ed-1/en/ontology/RecurringEvent# | YearlyRecurringEvent | class | A YearlyRecurringEvent recurs regularly on the same day of the same month, as specified by the hasMonth and dayOfMonth properties. As with MonthlyRecurringEvent, there may be ambiguity regarding the semantics of a yearly recurring event, however this formalization captures only the notion of an event that recurs on the same day of the same month (e.g. a birthday). |
