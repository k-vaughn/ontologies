Within large domains, such as ITS, ontologies can become quite large and encompass expertise from many fields. To manage this complexity, the ITS ontology is broken down into multiple ontology efforts, each represented in one or more ontology files. In some cases (e.g., location referencing), the expertise extends beyond ITS, and we adopt or adapt more widely referenced definitions from other domains (e.g., ISO TC 211, ISO/IEC JTC 4).</p> <p>Each ontology file is intended to be a modular representation of a set of inter-related concepts. A given topic area might have a single ontology file representing the topic or might have multiple files. For example, while a single representation might be preferred for many topics, complex topics like location referencing can have alternative ontology files for OpenLR, LRC, TPEG-Loc, etc.</p> <p>Ontologies use unique identifiers (e.g., URIs) to scope terms and avoid conflicts with other ontologies. Within the scope of this effort, it is recommended to use one namespace per ontology file.</p> <p>By carefully scoping ontologies, developers ensure they remain focused on their intended purpose while being extensible and interoperable with other systems.</p> <p>Ideally, the ITS domain will eventually be represented with a broad range of ontology files addressing different topic areas within ITS but heavily reusing a more core set of foundational concepts.
